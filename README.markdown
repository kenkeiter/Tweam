Tweam
=====
A tiny Sinatra-based Twitter stream reader, with a README to match! Ensure that you have the following gems installed:

- Sinatra
- Sass
- Erb
- Json
- Twitter

and simply execute the following command to run the server:

    ruby tweam.rb

Disturbingly simple. Most of the real leg-work is done on the client-side in Javascript. Heck, you could do the whole thing in Javascript, but this was my first itty-bitty project using Sinatra (and was written in just over 15 minutes) so... there's that.

Anyway, have fun with Tweam. Happy hunting!
